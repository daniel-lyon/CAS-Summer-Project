just globs
step 1) clean all the data - just blues and can ignore reds for now
step 2) extract spectrum/sky subtrack from each - load up i nqfits view
step 3) add spectra together (co-add) - each sub galaxy in image
    spectra for each gc in file
    master spectrum
step 4) ppxf to get velocities
step 5) apply baryocentric correction
step 6) compare to host galaxy velocities
step 7) redshifts/masses/what i want to do/stellar populations

globular clusters are much easier to get spectrum on than galaxy clusters
